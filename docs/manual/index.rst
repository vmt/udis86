Welcome to udis86's documentation!
==================================

Udis86 is a disassembler engine that decodes a stream of binary
machine code bytes as opcodes defined in the x86 and x86-64 class
of Instruction Set Archictures. The core component of this project
is libudis86 which provides a clean and simple interface to
disassemble binary code, and to inspect the disassembly to various
degrees of detail. The library is designed to aid software
projects that entail analysis and manipulation of all flavors of
x86 binary code.
